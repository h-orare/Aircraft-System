# AirCraft Management System

This program manages aircraft for a hypothetical Delta Airlines Company. It has four classes:

1. Aircraft Class- Representing a single Aircraft.
2. Fleet Class- Representing the entire fleet of aircrafts
3. TextMenu Class- This class will store menu options
4. FleetDriver Class- The main class which provides abstraction, and also an execution point for the program

The program will read aircraft data from a file(datafleet.txt), store the data in an array, query this
data, allow you to add or remove an aircraft and perform other operations as given in menu options.
